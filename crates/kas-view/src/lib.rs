//! # Views
//!
//! Views allow virtual scrolling and query views over a data set, supporting
//! both sync and async access.
//!
//! Each visible data `Item` is assigned a **view widget**, with dynamic
//! re-assignment as the view changes.
//!
//! ## Data sets and clerks
//!
//! The full data set might be available in local memory, on disk, or on a
//! remote server.
//!
//! A [`DataClerk`] manages all interactions between the view and the data as
//! well as providing a local cache of (at least) the currently visible data.
//!
//! ### Data generators
//!
//! A higher-level interface is provided for data generators: [`DataGenerator`].
//!
//! ## View controller
//!
//! This crate provides the following **view controllers**:
//!
//! -   [`ListView`] constructs a row or column view over items indexed by type `usize`
//! -   [`GridView`] constructs a table over items indexed by type `(u32, u32)`
//!
//! ## Driver
//!
//! A view controller uses a **driver** to construct and re-assign view widgets.
//! Simple types (strings and numbers) may use a pre-defined [`driver`],
//! otherwise a custom implementation of [`Driver`] is required.
