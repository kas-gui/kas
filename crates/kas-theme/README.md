KAS Theme
======

Theme support for KAS.


Optional features
-------

This crate has the following feature flags:

-   `font-kit` (enabled by default): uses the `font-kit` crate to locate a
    suitable system font; otherwise a hard-coded font path is used
-   `gat`: enables usage of the Generic Associated Types feature (nightly only
    and currently unstable), allowing some usages of `unsafe` to be avoided.
    (The plan is to enable this by default once the feature is mature.)
