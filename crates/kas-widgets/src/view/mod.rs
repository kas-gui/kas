//! View widgets and shared data
//!
//! So called "view widgets" allow separation of data and view. The system has
//! some similarities with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, but with
//! different separations of responsibility. Perhaps we should instead call the
//! pattern Model-View-Driver?
//!
//! # Shared data and *model*
//!
//! Shared data must implement several traits, namely those in
//! [`kas::updatable`] and one of the "view" traits: [`SingleData`],
//! [`ListData`] or [`MatrixData`]. These traits together form the "model".
//!
//! For simpler cases it is not always necessary to implement your own shared
//! data type, for example `SharedRc<i32>` implements [`SingleData`] and
//! `&'static [&'static str]` implements [`ListData`]. The [`SharedRc`] type
//! provides an `update` method and the version counter required to synchronise
//! views; `&[T]` does not (data is constant).
//!
//! # View widgets and drivers
//!
//! Standard widgets may be used to view data items, but to construct these a
//! *driver* is required. These implement the [`Driver`] trait which constructs
//! widgets from data items and optionally also the reverse binding.
//!
//! The user may implement a [`Driver`] or may use a standard one:
//!
//! -   [`driver::Default`] constructs a default view widget over various data types
//! -   [`driver::DefaultNav`] is a variant of the above, ensuring items support
//!     keyboard navigation (e.g. useful to allow selection of static items)
//! -   [`driver::CheckBox`] and [`driver::RadioBox`] support the `bool` type
//! -   [`driver::Slider`] constructs a slider with a fixed range
//!
//! In MVC terminology, the driver is perhaps most similar to the controller,
//! while the widgets constructed by the driver are the view, but this analogy
//! is not quite accurate.
//!
//! # Views
//!
//! Something else is required to construct one or more view widgets over the
//! data model as well as to perform event handling (at a minimum, forwarding
//! events to the appropriate view widgets), and that thing is here referred to
//! as the **view** (MVC terminology, it is part view and part controller, while
//! not being the whole of either).
//!
//! These *views* are widgets and provide additional services:
//!
//! -   updating view widgets when the model is changed
//! -   notifying other users of the data when view widgets update the data
//! -   ideally allowing `O(v)` performance where `v` is the number of visible
//!     data items, thus allowing good scaling to large data sets (this depends
//!     on the performance of the model)
//! -   supporting scrolling (see [`super::Scrollable`])
//! -   supporting item selection
//! -   controlling scrolling and selection via otherwise unhandled events
//!
//! The following views are provided:
//!
//! -   [`SingleView`] creates a view over a [`SingleData`] object (no scrolling
//!     or selection support)
//! -   [`ListView`] creates a scrollable list view over a [`ListData`] object
