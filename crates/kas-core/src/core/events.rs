/// Widget event-handling
///
/// This trait governs event handling as part of a [`Widget`] implementation.
/// It is used by the [`#widget`] macro to generate hidden [`Widget`] methods.
///
/// # Implementation
///
/// The implementation of this trait may be omitted where no event-handling is
/// required. All methods have a default implementation.
///
/// ## Foreign items
///
/// The [`#widget`] macro permits implementation of the following items within
/// `impl Events`:
///
/// -   `type` [`Widget::Data`]
///
/// ## Call order
///
/// ### Configuration
///
/// It is required that widgets are configured before other methods are called.
/// This is invoked by calling [`ConfigCx::configure`] or [`EventCx::configure`]
/// and involves the following operations:
///
/// 1.  Set the widget [`Id`], as returned by [`Tile::id`]
/// 2.  Call [`Events::configure`]
/// 3.  Call [`Events::update`]
/// 4.  Recurse configuration to children (see [`Events::recurse_indices`])
/// 5.  Call [`Events::post_configure`]
///
/// Note that both [`configure`](Self::configure) and [`update`](Self::update)
/// may be called before child widgets have been configured. This is important
/// to ensure that parent widgets are always updated before their children. Any
/// logic using child identifiers should be placed in
/// [`post_configure`](Self::post_configure).
///
/// Configuration may be repeated at any time.
///
/// ### Update
///
/// Widgets must be updated during configure (see above), since
/// [`Events::update`] must be called before sizing and before other widget
/// methods.
///
/// Widgets must also be updated after their input data (see [`Widget::Data`])
/// changes (unless not visible, in which case the update may be postponed until
/// they become visible). Updates may happen at other times (mostly because
/// data-change-detection has false positives). Note that custom widgets with
/// state must explicitly update affected children when their state changes.
///
/// An update is invoked by calling [`ConfigCx::update`] or [`EventCx::update`],
/// resulting in the following operations:
///
/// 1.  Call [`Events::update`]
/// 2.  Recurse the update to children (see [`Events::recurse_indices`])
///
/// ### Sizing
///
/// See [`Layout#sizing`].
///
/// It is expected that widgets are sized after [configuration](#configuration)
/// before any other `Events` methods are called, though it is not required that
/// sizing is repeated after re-configuration. It might theoretically be
/// possible to receive a message through [`Events::handle_messages`] before the
/// widget is sized through [`EventState::send`] (or other `send_*` method)
/// being called during configuration or update of this widget or a parent.
///
/// [`#widget`]: macros::widget
pub trait Events: Widget + Sized {
    /// Does this widget have a different appearance on mouse over?
    ///
    /// If `true`, then the mouse moving over and leaving the widget will cause
    /// a redraw. (Note that [`Layout::draw`] can infer the mouse-over state and
    /// start animations.)

    ///
    /// This is used to assign children identifiers. It may return
    /// [`Id::default`] in order to avoid configuring the child, but in
    /// this case the widget must configure via another means.
    ///
    /// If this is implemented explicitly then [`Tile::find_child_index`] must
    /// be too.
    ///
    /// Default impl: `self.id_ref().make_child(index)`

    /// Probe a coordinate for a widget's [`Id`]
    ///
    /// Returns the [`Id`] of the widget expected to handle clicks and touch
    /// events at the given `coord`. Typically this is the lowest descendant in
    /// the widget tree at the given `coord`, but it is not required to be; e.g.
    /// a `Button` may use an inner widget as a label but return its own [`Id`]
    /// to indicate that the button (not the inner label) handles clicks.
    ///
    /// # Calling
    ///
    /// Call [`Tile::try_probe`] instead.
    ///
    /// # Implementation
    ///
    /// The callee may usually assume that it occupies `coord` and may thus
    /// return its own [`Id`] when no child occupies the input `coord`.
    /// If there are cases where a click within [`Layout::rect`] should be
    /// considered a miss (non-rectangular hit-testing) then
    /// [`Tile::try_probe`] must be implemented instead.
    ///
    /// If the [`Tile::translation`] is non-zero for any child, then the
    /// coordinate passed to that child must be translated:
    /// `coord + translation`.
    ///
    /// ## Default implementation
    ///
    /// The default implementation returns `self.id()` and may be used for
    /// childless widgets. If the [`layout`](macro@crate::layout) attribute
    /// macro is used or an explicit implementation of [`Tile::try_probe`] is
    /// provided, these are used instead of the default implementation of this
    /// method.
