/// [`Draw`] and extension traits such as [`DrawRounded`] provide draw
/// functionality over this object.
///
/// This type is used to present a unified mid-level draw interface, as
/// available from [`crate::theme::DrawCx::draw_device`].
/// A concrete `DrawIface` object may be obtained via downcast, e.g.:
/// ```ignore
/// # use kas::draw::{DrawIface, DrawRoundedImpl, DrawSharedImpl, DrawCx, DrawRounded, color::Rgba};
/// # use kas::geom::Rect;
/// # struct CircleWidget<DS> {
/// #     rect: Rect,
/// #     _pd: std::marker::PhantomData<DS>,
/// # }
/// impl CircleWidget {
///     fn draw(&mut self, mut draw: DrawCx) {
///         // This type assumes usage of kas_wgpu without a custom draw pipe:
///         type DrawIface = DrawIface<kas_wgpu::draw::DrawPipe<()>>;
///         if let Some(mut draw) = DrawIface::downcast_from(draw.draw_device()) {
///             draw.circle(self.rect.into(), 0.9, Rgba::BLACK);
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```

/// per-window draw state. As such, it is normal to pass *a new copy* created
/// via [`DrawIface::re`] as a method argument. (Note that Rust automatically
/// "reborrows" reference types passed as method arguments, but cannot do so
