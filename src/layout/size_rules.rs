/// Widget sizing information
///
/// This is the return value of [`kas::Layout::size_rules`] and is used to
/// describe size and margin requirements for widgets. This type only concerns
/// size requirements along a *single* axis.
///
/// All units are in pixels. Sizes usually come directly from [`SizeHandle`]
/// or from a fixed quantity multiplied by [`SizeHandle::scale_factor`].
///
/// ### Sizes
///
/// The widget size model is simple: a rectangular box, plus a margin on each
/// side. Widget sizes are calculated from available space and the `SizeRules`;
/// these rules currently include:
///
/// - the minimum size required for correct operation
/// - the preferred / ideal size
/// - a [`StretchPolicy`]
///
/// Available space is distributed between widgets depending on whether the
/// space is below the minimum, between the minimum and preferred, or above
/// the preferred size, with widgets with the highest [`StretchPolicy`] being
/// prioritised extra space. Usually rows/columns will be stretched to use all
/// available space, the exception being when none have a policy higher than
/// [`StretchPolicy::Fixed`]. When expanding a row/column, the highest stretch
/// policy of all contents will be used.
///
/// ### Margins
///
/// Required margin sizes are handled separately for each side of a widget.
/// Since [`SizeRules`] concerns only one axis, it stores only two margin sizes:
/// "pre" (left/top) and "post" (right/bottom). These are stored as `u16` values
/// on the assumption that no margin need exceed 65536.
///
/// When widgets are placed next to each other, their margins may be combined;
/// e.g. if a widget with margin of 6px is followed by another with margin 2px,
/// the required margin between the two is the maximum, 6px.
///
/// Only the layout engine and parent widgets need consider margins (beyond
/// their specification). For these cases, one needs to be aware that due to
/// margin-merging behaviour, one cannot simply "add" two `SizeRules`. Instead,
/// when placing one widget next to another, use [`SizeRules::append`] or
/// [`SizeRules::appended`]; when placing a widget within a frame, use
/// [`SizeRules::surrounded_by`]. When calculating the size of a sequence of
/// widgets, one may use the [`Sum`] implementation (this assumes that the
/// sequence is in left-to-right or top-to-bottom order).
///
/// ### Alignment
///
/// `SizeRules` concerns calculations of size requirements, which the layout
/// engine uses to assign each widget a [`Rect`]; it is up to the widget itself
/// to either fill this rect or align itself within the given space.
/// See [`kas::Layout::set_rect`] for more information.
///
/// For widgets with a stretch policy of [`StretchPolicy::Fixed`], it is still
/// possible for layout code to assign a size larger than the preference. It is
/// up to the widget to align itself within this space: see
/// [`kas::Layout::set_rect`] and [`kas::AlignHints`].
///
