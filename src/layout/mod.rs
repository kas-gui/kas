//! Layout solver
//!
//! Size units are physical (real) pixels. This applies to most of KAS.
//!
//! ## Data types
//!
//! [`SizeRules`] is the "heart" of widget layout, used to specify a widget's
//! size requirements. It provides various methods to compute derived rules
//! and [`SizeRules::solve_seq`], the "muscle" of the layout engine.
//!
//! [`AxisInfo`], [`Margins`] and [`Stretch`] are auxilliary data types.
//!
//! [`MarginSelector`] is a utility type facilitating user-selection of margins.
//!
//! ## Layout engines
//!
//! The [`RulesSolver`] and [`RulesSetter`] traits define interfaces for
//! layout engines:
//!
//! -   [`SingleSolver`] and [`SingleSetter`] are trivial implementations for
//!     single-child parents
//! -   [`RowSolver`] and [`RowSetter`] set out a row or column of children.
//!     These are parametrised over `S: RowStorage` allowing both efficient
//!     operation on a small fixed number of children with [`FixedRowStorage`]
//!     and operation on a over a `Vec` with [`DynRowStorage`].
//! -   [`GridSolver`] and [`GridSetter`] set out children assigned to grid
//!     cells with optional cell-spans. This is the most powerful and flexible
//!     layout engine.
//!
//! [`RowPositionSolver`] may be used with widgets set out by [`RowSetter`]
//! to quickly locate children from a `coord` or `rect`.
