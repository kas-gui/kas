//! KAS GUI Toolkit
//!
//! This, the main KAS crate, is a wrapper over other crates designed to make
//! content easily available while remaining configurable. The following crates
//! (some optional, dependant on a feature flag) are re-exported by this crate:
//!
//! - [`kas_core`] is re-export at the top-level
//! - [`easy-cast`](https://crates.io/crates/easy-cast) is re-export as [`kas::cast`](cast)
//! - `kas_macros` is an extended version of [`impl-tools`](https://crates.io/crates/impl-tools),
//!     re-export as [`kas::macros`](macros)
//! - [`kas_widgets`] is re-export as [`kas::widgets`](widgets)
//! - [`kas_resvg`] is re-export as [`kas::resvg`](resvg) (`resvg` or `tiny-skia` feature)
//! - [`kas_view`] is re-export as [`kas::view`](view) (`view` feature)
//! - [`kas_theme`] (`theme` feature) is re-export under
//!     [`kas::theme`](kas_theme); note that this module contains content from
//!     both [`kas_theme`] and [`kas_core::theme`]
//! - [`kas_wgpu`] is re-export as [`kas::shell`](shell); in the current version
//!     this is dependant on [WGPU](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu), but in the
//!     future this should become a shim over multiple back-ends
//! - [`kas_dylib`] (`dynamic` feature) is used dynamic linking; this crate is
//!     not used directly â€” simply enabling the `dynamic` feature is enough to
//!     use dynamic linking.
//!
//! Also refer to:
//!
//! -   [KAS Tutorials](https://kas-gui.github.io/tutorials/)
//! -   [Examples](https://github.com/kas-gui/kas/tree/master/examples)

/// using widgets in a GUI.
