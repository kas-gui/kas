//! High-level drawing interface
//!
//! A [`Theme`] provides a high-level drawing interface. It may be provided by
//! the toolkit or separately (but dependent on a toolkit's drawing API).
//!
//! A theme is implemented in multiple parts: the [`Theme`] object is shared
//! by all windows and may provide shared resources (e.g. fonts and textures).
//! It is also responsible for creating a per-window [`Window`] object.
//!
//! Finally, the [`SizeHandle`] and [`DrawHandle`] traits provide actual sizing
//! and drawing information for widgets. Widgets are provided implementations of
//! these traits within calls to the appropriate [`Widget`] methods.
//!
//! [`Widget`]: crate::Widget
